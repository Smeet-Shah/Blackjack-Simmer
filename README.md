# Blackjack-Hand-Sim
Simulates thousands of Blackjack hands and keeps track of earnings.

Given a player-type, the C++ program will keep track of earnings and hands won whilst simulating. 
The player-types that I've tested are:
- CARD COUNTER
  - Plays with a running count, calculating with Hi-Lo strategy
- Basic Player
  - Follows strictly Basic Strategy
- Reckless
  - me :)

Working on making an interface that allows the hands to be visulaized and earnings to be visualized.
